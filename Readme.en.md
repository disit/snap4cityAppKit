 - Android Studio >= 3.0.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
 - [Grunt >= 1.0.1](https://gruntjs.com/)
 - USB drivers related to the device on which you will test the generated app (i.e. [SAMSUNG](http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/DR/201602/20160217043054798/SAMSUNG_USB_Driver_for_Mobile_Phones_v1.5.45.00.exe))

# First Start

 1. Installed the requirements you will need to download this project from github and place it in a folder within the PC.
 2. Open the "Command Prompt" and navigate to the project root.
 3. Install the following packages with commands:
	* npm install grunt-json-merger
	* npm install grunt-contrib-concat
	* npm install grunt-contrib-clean 
 4. Run the 'build' command (this command will merge the js and json labels files respectively and save the resulting files in www/js/build)
 5. Building result
	* If everything has been successful you will have received as output (obviously the seconds that took to build can change), followed by the path that indicates where the debug APK was created. (di default %YOUR_FOLDER%/snap4cityAppkit/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk:
	```
	BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3m 40s
		47 actionable tasks: 13 executed, 34 up-to-date
		Built the following apk(s):
		```
 	* If an error message appears regarding licenses that are not accepted, you must open Android Studio and check that the SDK has been installed via SDK Manager and install any proposed updates. During such updates you will be asked to accept some licenses and this will unlock the error that occurred during apk build. Once this is done, follow point 4.

N.B.: When a new module is created, for the display of the new button in the menu, you must insert the JSON object relative to the button in the file www/js/data/json/PrincipalMenu. json.
